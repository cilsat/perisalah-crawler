# A list of hardcoded regexes to recognise categories in each domain. 
# An ugly fucking hack if there ever was one.
# Each line defines a set of regexes to the corresponding domain in sources.txt.
# After running source.set_categories() in our extended Source class, we manually recheck the url list for urls that match the patterns specified here. This is so we don't need to extend the ContentExtractor class.
# Then we append this to the list of current categories.
